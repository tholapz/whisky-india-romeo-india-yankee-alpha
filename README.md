>I have never met anyone quite like you
You're charming, beautiful in your own ways.
You're intelligent, yet humble.
You're wise, and youthful.
You're kind and sweet.
You're a light, radiating through this world of superficials.

>I've been looking for someone, for the longest time.
A person which whom I can be myself with.
I really like the time spending with you.
Thank you for taking a chance with me.
I can be super annoying sometimes. I can be oblivious.
I'm nobody, mediocre at best.
I'm just trying to get by in this world, doing times.
Without meaning, purposes, I live my life in waiting.

>In your eyes, I see the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.
I was losing hope, thinking Love is lost, and I will never find it.
I never knew that, there can be someone waiting for me.
